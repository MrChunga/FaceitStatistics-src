# Faceit Statistics Finder Project
Faceit Statistics Finder Project

Website made with Django, bootstrap, & chart.js that displays third party API information from FACEIT(a Counter-Strike:GO matchmaking platform) 

If you plan to deploy this source code you'll run into a lot of problems, I recommend just looking at views.py urls.py and settings.py for taking a look at how it works and starting your own django app from scratch. TL;DR: Deprecated django stuff is in here.
